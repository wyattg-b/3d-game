My game is set in a cold, snowy forest where the player is constantly being hunted by a dangerous enemy. The environment is filled with walls, small hills, trees of various  sizes, and abandoned buildings that the player must navigate to survive. The main gameplay loop focuses on movement, exploration, and combat as the player avoids or fights the enemy using a blue energy blade. The goal is to stay alive by using the terrain for cover. The player must use position and strategy skills to survive
Player and enemy use mesh instances and collision shapes. I attached a section of player script: Pressing attack swings the blade; a timer controls swing speed. Esc Exit button quits the game. I also included many CSG shapes including boxes, and cylinders. I used these shapes for the trees and buildings. I added a NavigationAgent3D to the enemy so it can move around obstacles and chase the player automatically.I added a NavigationRegion to the level so the enemy knows where it can walk and avoid obstacles.
We were not allowed to use outside resources for this project, so I included many CSG shapes together and changed the color using New Standard material. This is how I got the color for the trees and buildings. For example I used green cone like shapes for the trees.
The game opens up with my main menu, you will have the option to play or quit, when you press play it goes to main. My game uses right click and WASD +spacebar.
